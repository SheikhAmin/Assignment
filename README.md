# # WPPOOL ASSIGNMENT TASK E

I couldn't add .env file as cypress do not allow it. Instead I used cypress.env.json file for my need. 

## To run this please follow the below step(Please make sure you have node install in your local machine):

- Download the directory in your local machine and open it on vs code.
- Open vs code terminal and type :npm install cypress --save-dev
- After that type:npx cypress open.
- Then a window will pop up . Select E2E Testing and then Select continue.
- After that click Start E2E Testing in Chrome.
